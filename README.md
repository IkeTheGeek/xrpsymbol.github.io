## XRP Symbol

[Follow us on Twitter!](https://www.twitter.com/xrpsymbol)

In order for XRP to be perceived as a "currency", it needs its own symbol. Just like the dollar sign "$", XRP needs a universal sign that denotes units of XRP. The current logo being used works great when referencing "Ripple" the company, and it **should not be changed**, but a _character_ should be created to represent actual units of the digital asset. Bitcoin for instance, uses the ₿ symbol within an orange circle in an angle, and additional symbols have been suggested for the actual units, eg: ₿, Ƀ or ฿. This repository intends to allow collaboration to create the ubiquitous XRP units symbol that we can use to display the amount of XRP.

### The XRP Symbol Proposal 
` Submitted by Claire Arthurs Kart - Head of Community at Ripple`

### Other Suggestions

The following symbol contains the letters X, R and P hidden within the shape. The symbol also displays the shape of a "drop" or "droplet". A drop is the smallest XRP denomination (1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops). The droplet was positioned in equilibrium, perpendicular to the "top left to bottom right" line on the "X". If the symbol is rotated _120°_, the "drop" hangs in perfect equilibrium. An interesting fact about this is that _120_ is an [untouchable number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untouchable_number), and the first multiply perfect number of order 3 (a [triperfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_perfect_number#Triperfect_numbers) number). The sum of its factors (including 1 and itself) sum to 360; exactly 3 x 120.

### Use Case Example

### Why a symbol?

Ripple XRP already uses an existing unofficial ISO 4217 code, *XRP*. While using *XRP* as a prefix to an amount is possible, currencies like the U.S. Dollar use both the 3 character ISO code and a symbol, USD and $ respectively. In terms of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was recently given a new symbol in the Unicode Standard (₿). XRP is no different, as XRP meets the definition of a currency in some cases.

#### What are the characteristics of a "currency"?
> 1. Scarce: There will ever be a maximum of 100 Billion XRP created.
> 2. Durable: XRP is digital, thus it does not degrade with use.
> 3. Portable: XRP can be stored and moved in digital storage, eg: flash drives¹, mobile phone wallets¹.
> 5. Authenticity Verification: XRP can be traced using the XRP Ledger and transactions are recorded in [consensus](https://ripple.com/build/xrp-ledger-consensus-process/#the-xrp-ledger-protocol-consensus-and-validation).
> 6. Storage: XRP can be stored in a universal distributed network of computers (distributed ledger) and digital wallets¹.
> 7. Fungible: All XRP's are considered equal and valued equally.

Note: As people accept XRP in exchange for goods and services, and considering the aformentioned characteristics, the need for a universally recognizable symbol for representing the units of XRP is apparent.

> ¹Digital wallets and storage mediums refer to storing a seed (secret key) in a device that cryptographically references a public address in the distributed ledger. These wallets synchronize with the ledger to determine transactions, balances, etc.

### What's next?

Once we agree on a symbol, we need to create a glyph that will need to be submitted to the [Unicode Consortium](https://unicode.org) for consideration. In order to be considered, we will need to get support from the community and a sponsor that can submit the [application](https://unicode.org/L2/L2014/14232-n4502-form.pdf) for the successful implemetation of this character into the Unicode Standard.
